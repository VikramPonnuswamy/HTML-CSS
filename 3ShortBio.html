                <h3> Biography of Sir Tim Berner-Lee: The Inventor of the World Wide Web </h3>
                <p> Sir Tim Berner-Lee is a British scientist who invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 whilst working at CERN (The European Particle Physics Laboratory). Sir Tim was exposed to world of “1”s and “0”s from a very young age by his parents who both worked on the first commercial computer – Ferranti Mark 1<sup>[4]</sup>. Berner-Lee completed physics degree from the University of Oxford in 1976. Upon the completion of his degree, he became a software consultant before making his way to CERN.</p>
                <p> While he worked at CERN, he initially developed a technique known as hypertext which could store information that is filed and contained links across same and different files. Four years later, Sir Tim proposed and developed the global hypertext document system which would use the internet and allow CERN researchers to share their results, techniques and practices without the need to email, whereby information was readily available online. Subsquently, leading to the development of the first web server and first WWW client – Browser. The WWW uses internet to store hypertext document in the servers and retrieves all the hypertext document that contains the keyword(s) that has been searched by the user. Hypertext document is written in hypertext markup language which is used to formatting system for displaying material over the internet<sup>[4]</sup>. To enable the exchange of hypertext document over the internet, Berner-Lee developed the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) between 1989 and 1991. In layman’s terms, web browsers are HTTP clients that send files requests to requests to the web server <sup>[7]</sup>. HTTP contains specific instruction on how to read and process a hypertext document. </p>
                <p> Berner-Lee also founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994, working with companies to improve and create a standard for the web. His vision is to preserve the web and ensure that web is free, non-proprietary and accessible to everyone.</p>
