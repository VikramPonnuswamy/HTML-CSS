        <h3>Key Learning Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            In this module I took my problem-solving skill and critical thinking to a next level. I have a learnt a new approach of problem solving in systematic manner which I can apply every day. For this HTML and CSS based assessment, I applied computational thinking approach to derive solution that both humans and computers can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, I took the task and  analysed the requirements; This being website creation using HTML and styled using CSS. Then I hand drew how I planned to structure the pages and the contents to include in these pages - <i>see below images for reference.</i> After this, I had a vague idea of how I was going to structure the page, but I required the physically content for insertion, while ignoring the relevant details such as fonts to use, images to use, choice of colour or how the website were to be styled. Having written the content, the next steps was to create a HTML page. Once again ignoring the irrelevant details of styles, fonts, etc. I created a HTML page where the content was visible when used with web browser. This is when I noticed a pattern in my code and how the hypertext document was structured using elements were common in all pages. To maintain the consistency of the page’s colours, fonts etc, I resolved to single CSS file which used “header”, ”footer”, “main” to apply the same styling across all pages. This pattern recognition allowed me to be more efficient and ultimately time saving. In all of this, the HTML and CSS files are my algorithm – coded using elements, tags etc which can be parsed by the computer and allow the imagination into a visual creation. The solution is the website which is simple and neatly presented for human to read and has been read by computer to display the contents.
        </p>
        <!-- NOTE THAT the width and height chosen by trial and error for all images in this website. styling in css and struggled massively hence resorted to this. 
        -->
        <div class="imageflex">
            <div class="img1">
                <img src="IMG_4868.jpg" alt="Hand drawn image detailing how the webiste should look with titles and boxes."
                width="400"
                height="500">
            </div>
            <div class="img2">
                <img src="IMG_4869.jpg" alt="Hand drawn image detailing how the webiste should look with titles and boxes."
                width="400"
                height="500">
            </div>
            <div class="img3">
                <img src="IMG_4870.jpg" alt="Hand drawn image detailing how the webiste should look with titles and boxes."
                width="400"
                height="500">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Overall, this website is evidence of computational thinking in practice demonstrating the four pillars. I continue to apply this logical process both in real life problems and future projects with other programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the computational thinking logic, I learnt main building blocks of procedural programming and other computation basics such as variables, operators, binary & hexadecimal numbers, data types etc. These refreshed my mind from previous hobby programming and A-level computer science. Which has proved benefical whilst learning javascript and python in Fundamental Programming module as well as applying computational thinking process for software engineering module for a group work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As Jeannette M voiced, computational thinking truly should be taught as part low key stage as it is a very important life skill.
